# A simple c program to check the validity of a credit card number
Only works for Mastercard, American Express, and  VISA cards. Returns invalid if any other card number is entered.
The code works using Luhn's Algorithm, learn more about [Luhn's Aglorithm here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)

Run the Executable file and enter any valid Amex, Mastercard or Visa card number at the prompt. You can find some test card numbers [here](https://developer.paypal.com/api/nvp-soap/payflow/integration-guide/test-transactions/).
If the card number is valid, then the program will return the name of the card provider.
