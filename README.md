# A simple c program to check the validity of a credit card number
Only works for Mastercard, American Express, and  VISA cards. Returns invalid if any other card number is entered.
The code works using Luhn's Algorithm, learn more about [Luhn's Aglorithm here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)

Copy the source code to your linux based terminal and compile it. 
Enter any valid Amex, Mastercard or Visa card number at the prompt. You can find some test card numbers [here](https://developer.paypal.com/api/nvp-soap/payflow/integration-guide/test-transactions/).
If the card number is valid, the program will return the name of the card provider.
